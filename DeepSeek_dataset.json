I think we just made our way into the world of the rich, it'll be a great story for the kids They push it in your head enough, I sometimes get nightmares of billboards @_@ don't tell anyone.

    "yeah I dont know what I should do.  If i should let them know or buy a new one and hope they dont notice. thanks for the advice.  I think it will be my best route going forward.  I need stop worrying about it and get back to my project I am working on a battle bot robot so I can enter a competition through my school  Cars are very coold as well however robots are much cheaper to work with at my age.  Maybe when I get older i'll restore a mustang. yeah you never know what the world will be like in 10 years! It just depends on how complex you want to get.  We have some basic bots that can cause a lot of damage with not much programming involved. You could replace the handle I suppose. I'd just let them know what happened and ask if they'd like for me to replace it with the same kind.  True story. What sort of project are you working on? Home remodeling? Automotive? That's really cool.  I've never built a bot before. I mostly work on cars. I've got a Mustang I'm getting ready to drag race.  Maybe you'll have robots to restore by then.   You really don't. Does that involve a lot of programming work or is it mostly mechanical? That's nice.  I wish I was into something more active myself.  I walk a couple miles a day to try and stay fit but it's not enough. ",

Pretty much, I am from Algeria and we're big on that. Gotta bring your own life in order first.  Yea and you feel like you're pressurizing them that away.

I hate to ask my friend for help because I know she can't say no.   That's it precisely.  I try not to ask unless I'm desperate and to help in return when I can.

I can never do anything right when she's around .   For example ?   Well , last week I invited her over to dinner .

I see . who \u2019 s the head of your household ?   it \u2019 s definitely my mother . And , her mother is definitely the matriarch of the bigger family .   that \u2019 s interesting . What does your grandfather think of your step-mother ?   at first , she was quite critical of her , but now that they \u2019 Ve been married for a few years , she \u2019 s starting to accept the fact that my father divorced my mother .   that \u2019 s pretty much how you feel about your step-mother .

    "how do you usually get to school ?   I usually ride my bike . Which form of transport do you prefer to use ?   I feel that I can see more when I pedal a bicycle , but when I feel lazy , I drive my car .   I think we should discourage people from using their private cars . They produce too much pollution !   I agree , but I would find it difficult to stop using my car . It's just so convenient .   cars might be convenient , but they're so bad for the environment .   do you have a car ?   no . I used to have one though . Once I started using my bicycle to get around , I found that I didn't really need it .   maybe if I sold my car now , I wouldn't be so tempted to use it .   you could try . It would save you a lot of money .   that's true . Every month , I spend hundreds of dollars on gas , insurance , and repairs .   if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving , you will get lots of exercise , too !   I could stand to lose a few pounds . Having a car has made me lazy . I never end up walking anywhere !   let's go to a car dealership . I'll help you try to sell your car for a good price .   sounds good ! Let's go ! ",

Yeah but , it is something that you will have forever ! They use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . On top of all that , I have heard it hurts a lot !   Really ?   Of course ! They use this machine with a needle that pokes your skin and inserts the ink .   Oh , I didn \u2019 t know that ! I thought they just paint it on your skin or something .   I think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . Also , find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used sterilized needles , and that the place is hygienic .   Maybe I should just get a tongue piercing ! ",

News about current affairs , documentaries , music , movies , noncommercial ads and so on .   Is there anything interesting ?   Yes , there are something good and informative . I think that many people underestimate the value of TV in education .   I agree . Are there any commercials on the TV ?   Of course . Because the TV stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .   That makes a lot of sense . Does the TV work well ?   Not always . It depends on the transmission of the satellite signals .   I got it . Do you pay for the programs ?   Yes , 50 Yuan per month . ",

It's a very popular game in America .   Yeah . I heard a lot about it . Is it really that fun ?   For me , it's one of those games that are fun to both watch and play .   Are you a football player ?   No , I just for fun with my friends . We play two hand touch or flag football . We're too old to play tackle football .   What is two hand touch and flag football ?   Instead of tackling somebody , you just have to touch them with two hands , or if it is flag football , grab the flag that the ball carrier is wearing .   I see . It's safer then right ?   Exactly . We play every Saturdays on the field by the tennis courts . If you want to learn and play a little , you're welcome to join us .   I'll give it a try . Give me a call and let's go down together .

I have no time to go on a date .   It is not your mother finding one for you ?   I will find one myself , of course . I \u2019 m a modern girl .   Perhaps you can try the three minutes date , the latest type .   You mean dozens of the opposite sex meet each other for three minutes in a dimly bar serving alcohol , I hate that idea .   No , there is an updated virgin , three minutes video date . I know an online dating website providing such service with a microphone and webcam , you can sigh for it . You can be face-to-face with a guy talking for maximum three minutes .   I don \u2019 t think it makes sense . Three minutes is such a short time .   I think you can find out if there is a possibility of romance within the first second of meeting someone , so-called love at first sight .   Anyway , I don \u2019 t want to post my face up for sale on the internet like that .   Don \u2019 t worry . There are many other options using the internet as dating methods . Some sites operate at international standard even have got certifications . Of course , for these sites , you have to pay a membership fee . But all in all , it is more serious and professional .

    "Oh , my God ! I've been cheated !   What ? What did you buy ?   It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it !   What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ?   There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick .   And ?   So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks .   And it's a brick ?   Yes .   I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ?   I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new .   So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic .   Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new .   But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ?   He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen .   Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated !   C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box .   That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there.Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks .   You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ? ",

What does this guy look like ? Is he hot ?   Well , I didn't think so at first . But as we started talking , I found him extremely funny and witty . I couldn't stop laughing at his jokes ! And we have so much in common . We like the same team , music , and most amazingly , we both love Chinese food ! I have the feeling that we are going to be great friends .   It seems you two are a good match . What qualities do you look for in a friend ?   There's nothing definite I think . I don't have a list or anything , but when I first meet somebody , I can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . It seems I have radar helping me spot new friends .   Well , that's something I've never heard of . But if you ask me what I value most in a friend , I would say honesty .   I agree . You can't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . Those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need .   Yeah , I know . A friend in need is a friend indeed . I don't need fair-weather friends either . ",

It \u2019 s all math , really . arcs , curves , velocity , cool stuff .   Yeah , yeah , but today \u2019 s lesson was all about the creation of the universe .   A physics class about the creation of the universe ? That \u2019 s some pretty unscientific language there . Sounds more religious to me .   It \u2019 s all religion . Take the theory of the Big Bang.How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion ? That \u2019 s no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back or African myths about turtles and stuff .   Turtles ? Whatever ... Look , all that \u2019 s required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and anti-particles . At least , that \u2019 s what the math says .   Math , sheath . What \u2019 s the evidence ?   There is evidence ! You know Edwin Hubble ? He \u2019 s the guy who in the early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe , thus advancing notions of an expanding universe . What would it be expanding from ? Well , the Big Bang ... DUH !   Anyway , it \u2019 s just a theory . Why do people go around touting theories ? Where \u2019 s the scientific rigor in that ?   Dude , don \u2019 t equivocate . A theory only becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing . You slept through class , didn \u2019 t you ? ",
    "Today more and more people advocate lifelong learning . But people have different views about lifelong learning . How do you understand lifelong learning ?   I think lifelong learning is the concept that it's never too soon or too late for learning   Does that mean studying all the time ?   I don't think so . I think it's about your attitude towards learning . One should be open to new ideas , decisions , skills or behaviors .   Then the axiom - ' You can't teach an old dog new tricks ' doesn't work any longer .   You're right . Lifelong learning is about finding learning opportunities at all ages and in numerous contexts   Yes , I agree with you . When I retired I will participate in programs to keep momentally active .   Me too . To keep up with the changing world , one must be involved in lifelong learning and be ready to accept new things .   You know what ? I've recently been teaching myself French .   Really ? That's great ! I know that your company has a lot of clients in France .   Yes , so I want to learn French to develop my career . ",

    "What \u2019 s the life expectancy in your country ?   I \u2019 m not sure , but probably about 75 years . How about in your country ?   About 70 , I think . This newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . It \u2019 s a problem that will soon affect most of the world .   I heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age , because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly .

I \u2019 m thinking about having a child , but not just yet .   Is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in you country ?   Yes , there is . Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . They want to go out , have fun , and explore the world . They want to develop their own view of life . Parents usually try to discourage them , but they don \u2019 t often succeed .   Parents usually give their children more freedom in my country . Sometimes they give them too much freedom .
